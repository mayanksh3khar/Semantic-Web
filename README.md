# Semantic Web Technologies Project

### Mayank Shekhar - RA1911003010879

**The goal of this project was to build an application for tourists and local residents having a special interest in objects named after famous personalities.**

The users start by opening the application and entering a location, to be more precise, the latitude and longitude of it, as well as their target radius. The application displays all objects for the location within the given radius that are named after a famous person. Examples for these objects are streets, churches and museums. The results are not only displayed in a list, but also on a map. 

To satisfy the users needs for knowledge, they can click on one of the results from the table to receive additional information about the famous person the object they clicked on is named after. These details shown include a short introduction about the person and other objects which are named after them. 

The app is deployed to heroku:
